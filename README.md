This project is a web-based vehicle management system that allows users to login and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on vehicle details.

The login page is developed using HTML and CSS, providing a simple and user-friendly interface for users to enter their login credentials.

Once logged in, users can access the main dashboard where they can fetch, add, and delete vehicle details.

The system provides a user-friendly interface for adding new vehicle details, including the vehicle make, model, year, and other relevant information. Users can easily fill out the form and submit it to add new vehicle details to the system.

Users can also view a list of all vehicle details, providing an at-a-glance overview of their vehicle information. They can sort the list by make, model, or year to quickly find the information they need.

The system also provides a simple way for users to delete vehicle details they no longer need. They can simply select the details they want to delete from the list and click a button to remove them from the system.

The backend of the system is developed using a database and programming language of your choice, providing a secure and reliable way to store and manage vehicle details.

Overall, this vehicle management system provides a convenient and efficient way for users to manage their vehicles and keep track of important details, improving their overall organization and productivity.
